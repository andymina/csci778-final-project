<p>We wanted to analyze the impact that Pres. Bush&#39;s No Child Left Behind (NCLB) and Pres. Obama&#39;s Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) had on NYC ELA exam performance. NCLB and ESSA treated schools wildly differently and each had a unique belief about how the budget should be allocated resulting in major performance differences.</p>
<p>NYC is the nation&#39;s largest public school system. Understanding how federal policy impacts the ELA scores of NYC can provide insight to how federal policy will influence ELA scores on a large scale. It&#39;s also important to learn the mistakes of past federal policies so we can better invest into the growing future of NYC&#39;s public education.</p>

<h2>Ethics</h2>

<details>
  <summary><h3>Ethical Problems</h3></summary>
  <details>
    <summary>    
      <b>An Informed Populace</b>
    </summary>
    <p>
      Often, legislation has to be marketed to the public in order to be passed. There are always votes to be won and bartered for in Congress, and these back-and-forths happen through promises and public opinion campaigns. If there is a narrative attached to a legislation, it must appeal to the emotions and senses of rationality of the people whose representatives will vote for it. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the case of No Child Left Behind, the narrative was that schools would no longer be &quot;rewarded&quot; for poor performance. Public Education had purportedly reached its apparently dire situation due to a twisted system of values in the education system. With the right laws in place, education districts and teachers would be <i>incentivized</i> to produce higher academic achievers due to their fear of a deterrent, in this case a lack of funding and threat of closure.
    </p>
    <p>
      By displaying education data visually and clearly, the task of arguing with sensationalized and/or emotionally charged public policies becomes significantly less psychological. Single dimensions of the short-term and long term effects that public policies have on educator behavior and student academic performance can be seen in the graphs we've created using 
      <span style="font-family: monospace;">numpy</span>,
      <span style="font-family: monospace;">pandas</span>,  
      <span style="font-family: monospace;">matplotlib</span>, and 
      <span style="font-family: monospace;">chart.js</span>.

      <b>Cold, Hard, Data</b>
      </summary>
      <p>...or is it? While standardized tests are often treated as an objective window into the academic performance of students, well-known accounts of teachers changing their curriculums completely to match the content of student assessment clouds the usefulness of the data collected on student achievement. In making standardized testing disproportionately important to students and/or educators, we can end up changing the meaning of a standardized test score.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>
        <b>Public Data</b>
      </summary>
      <p>While the datasets that we used for this project are public, the knowledge required to process the data and present it in the ways that we did is nowhere near as public. It would be a completely reasonable thing for the government to do to provide "Data Explorer" frontends for the data that they provide an API to. While anyone can download the data, that doesn't in itself make the data accessible to everyone.

  <details>
       <summary>
          <h3 id="no-child-left-behind">No Child Left Behind (2001 - 2015)</h3>
       </summary>
        <p><em>No Child Left Behind</em> (NCLB) was enacted in 2001 by President George W. Bush in an attempt to improve public education. When NCLB was unveiled, it set a goal for all students to achieve 100% proficiency in reading and math by 2014. To meet this goal NCLB held schools accountable through the tests scores its students earned on standardized exams, one of which was the ELA.</p>
<p>By NCLB policy, schools that failed to make sufficient yearly progress towards the proficiency goal of 2014 were deemed &quot;failing.&quot; Failing schools would receive less funding and inversely, schools that were meeting/exceeding expectations would get more funding. This left schools in a constant catch-22 to provide academic resources for struggling students. If a school failed to meet the benchmark, it could face closure.</p>
<p>As it became abundantly clear that high ELA scores was all that mattered, public trust in the education system became to disappear. Schools would inflate their scores to avoid closures and cut their curriculums to only focus on test material. In order to regain public trust and remedy a failing public education system, the federal government designed the <em>Common Core State Standards</em> (CCSS) in 2009 so schools could effectively prepare students for standardized exams. While CCSS were not officially mandated, NCLB did make it clear that schools that didn&#39;t adopt CCSS would receive less funding. NYC administered its first CCSS ELA in 2013.</p>

       <summary>
         <h3 id="every-student-succeeds-act">Every Student Succeeds Act (2015 - present)</h3>
       </summary>
        <p><em>Every Student Succeeds Act</em> (ESSA) was enacted in 2015 by President Barack Obama in an attempt to remedy a struggling public education system. ESSA removed the 2014 proficiency goal (set by NCLB) and allowed schools to set long-term or short-term goals for themselves which alleviated some of the pressure they were under.</p>
<p>ESSA also removed the funding catch-22 that NCLB has imposed. Aside from resolving the negative feedback loop, ESSA redefined a school&#39;s achievement status to be holistic than just standardized test results. With federal approval, states could design their own achievement standards and their own standardized exams.</p>
<p>Pres. Obama&#39;s ESSA set a precedent for further education reform by prohibiting the government from imposing any new curriculums upon the states. CCSS still existed at the time, but states were no longer coerced into adopting them.</p>

  <summary><h3>Analysis</h3></summary>

  <p>We begin our analysis by inspecting how each borough performed on the ELA by year. Since our project focuses heavily on the chronology of NYC ELAs, we figured an animation was the most fitting medium of conveying the data in certain areas.</p>

  <p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andymina/csci778-final-project/main/assets/Overall-Proficiency.gif" /></p>

  <p>Throughout all five boroughs, it's clear to see that 2013 was a particularly poor year for performance. For example, out of all of the students tested in the Bronx, just over 15% were ELA proficient. Other areas of the data will also reflect this massive dip in 2013 because this was the first year NYC used CCSS on the ELA.</p>

<p>
Before ESSA was introduced, proficiency rates by borough under NCLB were slowly declining. However, after ESSA is introduced proficiency rates rise back to their 2009 peak. When comparing ESSA's borough proficiency rate to NCLB, it's clear that ESSA performed better and has the potential to outshine NCLB.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andymina/csci778-final-project/main/assets/Children-Proficiency.gif" /></p>

<p>ESSA also out-performs NCLB with respect to SWD ELA proficiency as the general trend of improvement can be seen post-2015 (2016 was the first ESSA ELA). However, the quantitative SWD proficiency ELA is abysmal and shows that both policies have much room for improvement.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andymina/csci778-final-project/main/assets/SWD-Proficiency.gif" /></p>

<p>Zooming out from the borough-wide view towards a city-wide view, we were interested in how NYC's overall proficiency rate changed across each federal policy. As most schools do, we defined our "passing" grade to be 65%. The following graph shows what percent of NYC schools had a "passing" proficiency rate through the years.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andymina/csci778-final-project/main/assets/NYC-Proficiency.gif" /></p>

<p>
  In 2013, the first year of CCSS ELAs, just over 5% of NYC schools that took the state exam had a school-wide proficiency rate of at least 65%. The following years of the CCSS ELA didn't perform much better either.</p>
<p>
The 2013-2015 dip seen in the past four graphs can explained by a few factors:
<ol>
<li>From 2013-2015, NYC administered CCSS ELAs designed by NCLB which were notoriously difficult and arguably above grade-level for most students.</li>
<li>Schools were coerced into adopting a CCSS curriculum too early to secure funding by NCLB. </li>
<li>The budget catch-22 of NCLB prevented schools that were struggling before 2013 from obtaining an adequate budget leaving them further stranded once a CCSS ELA was administered.</li></ol>
<p>
After seeing that just over 5% of NYC schools had a passing proficiency, we was determined to "zoom into" the data and look at specific grades. Public education is the majority of any child's life. Children develop their personalities and general world outlook in public school so it's important to keep them mentally stimulated and encourage them to adopt a positive growth mindset in their early years. This led us to inspect the ELA data for Grades 3-5 during the Common Core Era.
</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andymina/csci778-final-project/main/assets/Common-Core-Bar.png" /></p>

<p>These numbers absolutely shocked us. In 2013, there were 9 schools that didn't have single 5th grader pass the ELA. Although CCSS were originally introduced to improve public school standards, its clear that it did nothing but cause more damage. We were also curious about the number of schools that had a less than stellar proficiency rate.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andymina/csci778-final-project/main/assets/NYC-Prof-Bar.png" /></p>
<p>
  NCLB caused more harm to the public education system than it expected to and ESSA acted as a band-aid to remedy the pain points. Although ESSA has done a great job at fixing NCLB's mistakes, it hasn't substantially improved the public education infrastructure. We believe that ESSA will continue to slowly improve public education measured through ELA scores in due time. This hypothesis led us to conduct a regression analysis between NCLB and ESSA vs. their budgets.
</p>

<p>

</p><p>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andymina/csci778-final-project/main/assets/NCLB-Budget.png" />
</p>

<p>
  It should be noted that ESSA had less time to develop, so there are about half as many data points. However, with the given data we can see that there is strong correlation between the total budget allocated to public education in NYC and the percent of proficienct students.
